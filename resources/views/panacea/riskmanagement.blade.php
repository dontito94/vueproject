                <p style="font-size:20px; line-spacing:20px;">Governance, risk management, and compliance or GRC is the umbrella term covering an organization's approach across these three areas: Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance. They are three related facets that help assure an organization meets its objectives.  While <strong>Governance</strong> is the combination of processes established and executed by the directors (or the board of directors) that are reflected in the organization's structure and how it is managed and led toward achieving goals, <strong>Risk Management</strong> is predicting and managing risks that could hinder the organization to achieve its objectives and <strong>Compliance</strong> refers to adhering with the company's policies, procedures, laws and regulations.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px; line-spacing:20px;">Well-developed information security governance processes result in information security management programs that are scalable with the business, repeatable across the organization, measurable, sustainable, defensible, continually improving, and cost-effective on an ongoing basis.  </p>
