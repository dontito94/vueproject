                <p style="font-size:20px; line-spacing:20px;">There are laws that are embedded with Information Security. These laws are enforced by regulatory bodies such as TCRA in Tanzania, ENISA in EU, and also used by Judiciary to make ruling of offenders, so as to protect the business customers as well as to protect business from malicious users of information. For instance: In Tanzania,<strong>Cybercrime and Electronic Transactions Acts
                </strong>  were enacted in September, 2015. Furthermore other laws are to come such as <strong>Data Protection Act (DPA). HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)</strong> is for United States. All such laws require individuals and organisations to comply with as long as their daily operation involve transactions of information.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px; line-spacing:20px;"><strong>Regulatory compliance</strong>
 is an organization's adherence to laws, regulations, guidelines and specifications relevant to its business. Violations of <strong>regulatory compliance regulations</strong> often result in legal punishment, including federal fines. Organisations face an ever increasing list of statutory, regulatory, contractual and legal compliance obligations.</p>
